## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I tried really hard to make this project similar to the original design and I think I did pretty well.

I saw many examples of solutions posted on the frontendmentor site.

### Things I learned trying to provide this solution.

- Familiarity with vh and vw size units and their use in website design.

- Teaching better responsiveness of phone and tablet screens and standard screen sizes for devices.

- Getting to know Google fonts.

- Learning the best practices of Flexbox technology.

### Continued development

I think I need to learn more about UI coloring and photo grid.
